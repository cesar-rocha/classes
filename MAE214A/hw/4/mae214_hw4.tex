\section*{Problem 1}


\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

    \item Figure \ref{fig:the_velocity}-top shows the different time-series at the grid-point $(65,2)$. 
        Of course, the instantaneous velocity at spanwise grid point 65 the red line in figure \ref{fig:the_velocity} presents by far the largest variance.
        The spanwise-averaged velocity presents a much smaller variance (the green line in figure \ref{fig:the_velocity} – it represents a relatively
        small variation about the time-and-spanwise mean velocity (the red line in figure \ref{fig:the_velocity}).

    \item We repeat the calculation of item (a) to grid points (65,8) and (65,20) – the results are presented in 
        middle and bottom panels of figure \ref{fig:the_velocity}. At each z level (distance from the wall), the
        relative magnitude and variance of the different curves are similar to the pattern described in item a, with
          \ref{fig:the_velocity}, with instantaneous velocities presenting the largest variance. But the magnitude of 
          the mean and variance vary significantly with the distance from the wall. Near the wall (top panel in figure \ref{fig:the_velocity}) the magnitudes of both mean and turbulent velocities are relatively small, significantly increasing at z-grid point 8. The largest mean flow is of course at the z-grid point 20. This is consistent with the shape of the
          mean flow which is, of course, largest in the middle of the channel, and vanished at the boundary. The magnitude of the turbulent velocities (the difference between the blue and red curves) appears to peak near grid point 8 (or perhaps between 8 and 20), consistent with the fact that the turbulence is largest where the mean velocity gradient is largest.

      \item Figure \ref{fig:the_mean_velocity} shows the time-and-spanwise mean velocity $<u^+>_{yt}$ as  a function
          of the distance form the wall in ``wall units'' ($z^+ \defn z/\delta_\nu$).


      \item Figure \ref{fig:the_mean_velocity2} shows the time-and-spanwise mean velocity $<u^+>$ as  a function
          of the distance form the wall in ``wall units'' from the mean profile given (Umean.dat). The dashed line indicates a log profile. Also identifies in  \ref{fig:the_mean_velocity2} are the viscous sublayer, the log-layer, and the
          law of the wake; the buffer layer spans the region between the viscous sublayer and the log-layer.

\section*{Problem 2}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Figure \ref{fig:my_stress} compares the Reynolds stresses and production for the CFD Lab experiment compared against the results for Moser et al. Both experiments were performed at $\Re = 395$. Note that, for comparison, we changed the CFD lab experiment nomenclature coordinates from $z^+$ to $y^+$ (distance from the wall in wall units), and $v$ to $w$, and vise versa. The results compare favorably for all terms; the largest component is  $<uu>$, which peaks at about $y^+ \approx 12$. The production also peaks at about $y^+ \approx 12$.

  \item Figure \ref{fig:my_stress} compares the off-diagonal Reynolds stresses for the CFD Lab experiment compared against the results for Hoyas and Jimenez. The former was performed at $\Re = 395$ and the latter at much higher Reynolds number $\Re = 2000$. The magnitude of $<uv>$ is comparable in the both case, and $<uw>$ and $vw$ are at residual levels in both cases.  Of course, in the high Reynolds number experiment $<uv>$ extends farther, decaying almost linearly with $y^+$ from $y^+=200$ to $y^+=2000$.

\section*{Problem 3}



\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

    \item The mean $x$-momentum equation in the boundary layer is
\beq
\label{eq:bl1}
<U>\frac{\p <U>}{\p x} + <V>\frac{\p <U>}{\p y} = \nu \frac{\p^2 <U>}{\p y^2} - \frac{\p <uv>}{\p y} -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\dd p_0}{\dd x}\com
\eeq
where the free stream pressure is
\beq
p_0(x) = <p> + <v^2>\com
\eeq
Noticing that the total shear stress is
\beq
\tau \defn \rho \nu \frac{\p <U>}{\p y} -\rho <uv>\com
\eeq
and using the mean $x$-momentum equation outside the boundary layer
\beq
U_0 \frac{\dd U_0}{\dd x} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\dd p_0}{\dd x}\com
\eeq
we can rewrite \eqref{eq:bl1}
\beq
<U>\frac{\p <U>}{\p x} + <V>\frac{\p <U>}{\p y} = \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\p \tau}{\p y} + U_0 \frac{\dd U_0}{\dd x}\per
\eeq
Further using the continuity equation
\beq
\frac{\p <U>}{\p x} + \frac{\p <V>}{\p y} = 0\com
\eeq
we obtain 
\beq
\frac{\p <U><U>}{\p x} + \frac{\p <U><V>}{\p y} = \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\p \tau}{\p y} + U_0 \frac{\dd U_0}{\dd x}\per
\eeq
Now multiplying the continuity equation by $U_0$ and combining with the momentum equation above we obtain
\beq
\frac{\p}{\p x}\left[<U>(U_0-<U>)\right] + \frac{\p}{\p y}
\left[<V>(U_0-<U>)\right] + (U_0-<U>)\frac{\dd U_0}{\dd x} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\p \tau}{\p y} \per
\eeq
Integrating in $y$ from $0$ to $\infty$ (outside the boundary layer), we obtain
\beq
\label{eq:bl_int}
-\frac{1}{\rho} \left(\underbrace{\tau^{\infty}}_{=0}-\tau^w\right) = \underbrace{\left[<V>(U_0-<U>)\right]^{\infty}_0}_{= 0} + \frac{\dd}{\dd x}\left(U_0^2 \theta\right) + \delta^*U_0 \frac{\dd U_0}{\dd x}\com
\eeq
where the momentum thickness is 
\beq
\theta(x) \defn \int_0^\infty \frac{<U>}{U_0}\left(1-\frac{<U>}{U_0}\right) \dd y\com
\eeq
and the displacement thickness
\beq
\delta^*(x) = \int_0^*\left(1 - \frac{<U>}{U_0}\right)\per
\eeq
Also, in \eqref{eq:bl_int} the total shear vanishes outside the boundary layer. The first term on the right of \eqref{eq:bl_int} also vanishes since at $y = 0$, $<U> = <V> = 0$, and, as $y\to\infty$, $<U>\to U_0$. Thus
\beq
\frac{\tau^w }{\rho} = \underbrace{\frac{\p}{\p x}\left(U_0^2 \theta \right)}_{U_0\frac{\dd \theta}{\dd x} + 2\theta U_0 \frac{\dd U_0}{\dd x}} + \delta^*U_0 \frac{\dd U_0}{\dd x}\per
\eeq
Thus, we obtain the von Karman integral momentum equation for a flat plate boundary layer
\beq
2 \frac{\dd \theta}{\dd x} + \frac{(4\theta + 2\delta^*)}{U_0}\frac{\dd U_0}{\dd x} = \frac{\tau^w}{\frac{1}{2}\rho U_0^2}\per
\eeq

\item The main differences between the turbulent channel flow and the boundary layer on a flat plate is that in the latter the boundary layer thickness grows with $x$ and, contrary to the channel flow where the mean where the given mean pressure gradients allows for the determination of the stress at the boundary, that stress at the wall is unknown a priori in the boundary layer problem. Pope also points out that, contrary to the channel flow problem, in the boundary layer problem, the flow outside the boundary layer consistent of intermittent turbulence. The main similarity is the behavior in the inner layer ($y/\delta(x)<1$).
