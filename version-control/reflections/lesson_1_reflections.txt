Q:  How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the 
    bug that was introduced?

A:  The command diff shows the difference between two files. In unix systems
    it shows lines that were developed with the symbol - and added line
    is shown by +.

Q:  How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
    efficient programmer in the long term?

A:  Tracking the entire history of a file can significantly help us knowing what
    changes where made, and when they where changes. This makes debugging new 
    versions a much smoother process.

Q:  How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

A:  git log keeps track of all commits every made in a project. It shows which files
    were changed and key words for the commit. git diff allows to understand the 
    difference between two different commit.

Q:  How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

A:  We can always return to a particular version of the code by using git checkout, which reverts the
    changes. By comparing different versions (git diff) we can always figure out what caused the code
    to break.

Q:  Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

A:  I want to become a git pro. I will use git for all my projects.
